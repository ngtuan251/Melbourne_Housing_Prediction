# Melbourne_Housing_Prediction
---

In this project, we preprocessed the Melbourne Housing Dataset, conducted Data Analysis and provided practical insights for house buyers into the Melbourne Housing Market.

Also, we implemented Feature Engineering to add more useful features (e.g distance from properties to the nearest stations) to the dataset.

Finally, we have built some tree-based models that can predict Melbourne housing prices which would help house buyers to make better decisions.
